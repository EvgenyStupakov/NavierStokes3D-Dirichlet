# NavierStokes3D-Dirichlet

Python script simulates a 3D velocity field in a cubic domain [0,L]^3 
with Dirichlet boundary conditions under a short impulsive force.

## How to use

1. Clone repository
2. Run the simulation:
3. Observe the "explosion and decay" of the velocity modulus in the console.

For detailed analytical derivation and formulas, see `doc/AnalyticalSolution.pdf`.
